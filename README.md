Machine Learning Model Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning models. Each notebook is focused on a specific type of model and includes explanations, code, and visualizations to help understand the application of these models in practical scenarios.

Notebooks

1. Logistic Regression Model (LogReg.ipynb)
This notebook explores the logistic regression model, providing a step-by-step guide on how it can be implemented and used for binary classification tasks.

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN.ipynb)
Here, we dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), showcasing their structure and usage in image recognition tasks.

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM.ipynb)
This notebook breaks down the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, detailing how it works and can be used for classification problems.

4. German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark CNN (GTSRBcnn.ipynb)
A specialized notebook focusing on a CNN model designed for the classification of traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.
